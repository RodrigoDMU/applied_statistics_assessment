## Applied Statistics - Assessment

This repository was created as part of the [Applied Statistics](https://www.atu.ie/courses/higher-diploma-in-science-data-analytics) assessment module for the course in the [Higher Diploma in Data Analytics](https://www.atu.ie/courses/higher-diploma-in-science-data-analytics). This README has been written with [Github's Documentation On READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in mind. [[1]](#1) This assesment is using the [assessment instructions](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/applied-statistics/blob/main/assessment/assessment.md) to demonstrate the skills developed in the course in data analysis and visualization. [[2]](#2) You can find more about [writing in Mark Down in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

## About This Assessment

This assessment is designed to evaluate your understanding and practical application of statistical concepts through hands-on simulation and analysis. The problems focus on probability, the behavior of sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, and comparisons of means using t-tests and ANOVA.

## Use of This Assessment

This assesssment is useful for demonstrating some of the skills developed for analysis, programming and data visualization using Jupyter Notebook (Python).

## Assessment Overview

### Problem 1: Extending the Lady Tasting Tea

- Extend the classic Lady Tasting Tea experiment.
- Simulate outcomes to estimate probabilities and interpret results in the context of hypothesis testing.
- Understand how experimental design affects the likelihood of observing extreme outcomes by chance.

### Problem 2: Normal Distribution

- Generate large sets of samples from the standard normal distribution.
- Compare sample and population standard deviations.
- Explore how sample size influences the variability and estimation of standard deviation.

### Problem 3: t-Tests

- Simulate independent samples with varying mean differences.
- Conduct t-tests to determine statistical significance.
- Investigate how type II error rates change as the true difference between populations increases.

### Problem 4: ANOVA

- Generate multiple independent samples with different means.
- Perform a one-way ANOVA and pairwise t-tests.
- Understand why ANOVA is preferred when comparing more than two groups to control for error rates.
