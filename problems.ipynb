    "In this problem, we investigated how the sample standard deviation (ddof=1) and the population standard deviation (ddof=0) behave when repeatedly estimated from many small samples drawn from a standard normal distribution. Using 100000 samples of size 10, we observed that the sample SD distribution is slightly higher on average and centers more closely around the true population standard deviation of 1. In contrast, the population SD systematically underestimates the true value, appearing left-shifted and slightly smaller. This difference arises because ddof=1 applies a correction for bias in small samples, whereas ddof=0 does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram shows that for small samples, ddof=1 produces a less biased and slightly larger estimate of the standard deviation, while ddof=0 underestimates it, but the two become nearly identical as sample size increases."
